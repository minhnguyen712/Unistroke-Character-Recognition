This project implements a system that can recognize handwritten digits drawn by the user.

The system allows the user to draw a digit on an HTML canvas using their mouse or touchscreen. A neural network model analyzes the digit after the user has finished drawing it and predicts the digit. The predicted digit is then printed on the screen. This allows it to recognize digits 0-9 based on the patterns learned from thousands of handwritten digit images.
